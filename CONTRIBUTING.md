CONTRIBUTING
============

This website is entirely developed and maintained by myself, if you plan to contribute, please consider writing [an issue]() instead.  

Whilst I definitely appreciate contributions, this website is a personal one. So I would like the code to remain 100% written by myself. Feel free to drop hints, tips, bug reports of any kind, just please don't send in a pull request.
